# Placeholder for my local server configuration
This one I am a bit unsure of the final location. This will technically be a different system, however the workflow it provides will tie in directly with the Catalyst system. It may simply end up in a folder within Notes, or within the parent folder Misc, or perhaps of a parent folder of its own, whose structure mimicks that of the main repository. I am also considering dropping it directly with the Catalyst config, but prefacing every file with `Server_` for example.
