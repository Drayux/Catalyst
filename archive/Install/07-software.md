# Flatpak applications
> ### Keeping end-user applications containerized fixes the majority of my library dependency issues

**\[ [â‡½ Previous](./06b-hyprland.md) \]**  

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Additional software (unsorted...needs desktop environment)
_**TODO:** My definition of "utility" has proven itself to be inconsistent. Lutris would count as a utility, but being a component of the games it launches, it only makes sense to use the Flatpak. Further, pavucontrol might also count as a utility, but as something where I use it rarely and for a single feature, I like the idea of it being "easily removable" from the system._

_As a result, I'm instead tempted to tweak the defintiton to "apps that are not essential to my system workflow (or otherwise are not available as flatpaks)" which would essentially leave just terminal emulators and file managers as non-flatpaks._

## Utility programs (therefore not flatpaks)
- `alacritty`
- `alsa-scarlett-gui` (a flatpak is not readily available for this yet)
- `carla`
- `kitty`
- `nautilus`

# Flatpaks
- Blender
- Calculator (Gnome Project)
- Firefox
- Flatseal
- Font Manager (_**TODO:**_ Discontinued, needs replacement)
- GIMP
- Helvum
- Inkscape
- Spotify
- Discord (Vesktop)
- VLC
- VSCodium
- ...
- (bitwarden)
- (pavucontrol - Technically a utility, but not a component of my standard workflow)
- (pince - Currently not available as a flatpak, may be best as a native package since it depends on memory scanning)

## Dedicated documentation
- Steam (games.md)
- Lutris (games.md)
- Prism Launcher (games.md)
- OBS Studio (content.md)
- Davinci Resolve (content.md)
- VSCodium (editors.md)

## Miscellaneous Add-ons
- `steam-devices-git`<sup>AUR</sup>
- AdwSteamGtk (a bit buggy but looks really nice)
- OBS VkCapture (https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture)

# Application info and configuration
## Browser
> **Archived content (out of date)**

### Wayland
Use environment variable: `MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1`  
_This is handled by the default configuration provided by the Flatpak_  

Note that this does break the application menu provided by KDE (no entries present, consistent with other wayland applications.)  

### Custom Theme
_**TODO:**_ My dream Firefox config would feature tree-style-tabs instead of the default tabs, but have a seamless integration (i.e. remove the default tabs at the start, have the tab sidebar be persistent or mouseover to show, etc.) Many of these customizations are possible via modifying the Firefox theme(?) directly, however I have yet to dive down this rabbit hole.  

This GitHub repo ([FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox)) showcases a custom Firefox theme that nearly perfectly matches the format and theming elements that I'd hope to obtain with my custom configuration. That said, it is built for a _very_ outdated version of Firefox (78.15 ; 112.0 is the current version as of writing this.)

Alternatively, the following is a similar type of Firefox configuration that also looks promising.

### Change Location of Profile Folder
Launch the profile manager by running `firefox --ProfileManager`  
When creating a new profile, select the "Choose Folder" button to specify a path to Firefox where the profile should be located.  

Unfortuantely, it should be noted that this does not prevent Firefox from saving the rest of its data in `~/.mozilla`  

### Access Advanced Settings
Inside the URL bar, the `about:` prefix specifies to Firefox to use a local command. Notably `about:about` presents a "help page" that lists all of the `about:` page entries.  

#### `about:about`
Presents a list of `about:` page entries  

#### `about:config`
Advanced Firefox configuration - Some settings here can break your profile  

#### `about:networking`
Displays active connections within Firefox - Can be used to identify sussy connections, also includes a DNS lookup  

#### `about:performance`
Displays useful performance diagnostics, somewhat like a "task manager" specific to browser tabs
