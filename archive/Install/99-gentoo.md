# Gentoo Notes
> ### TODO: Addendums for a Gentoo variation of this installation!

This will likely look like a bunch of additional "Gentoo notes" in the primary installation notes, with the contents of this file containing primarily preferred package selections and configurations (i.e. open-rc over systemd) as well as (apparently) gentoo-specific fixes like the manual inclusion of various system users to groups (such as video, usb, etc)

Sections for consideration:
- Global use flags overview (config files likely to also be provided)
- System users and their respective groups
- Kernel build options
- Per-package tweaks (akin to Notes/games.md)

As a far future consideration, the installation guide can be revamped to the common flow and extended notes can be added to this file and a supplemental 'artix.md'
> I'd have to decide carefully what type of infomation should be shared in the common document with the artix/gentoo distinctions versus information that would be best contained in the unique section. I don't want the document to feel like something where one would need to bounce between the two, so I believe that this should primarily contain post-installation setup.
