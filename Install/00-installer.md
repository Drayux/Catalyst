# Installation medium creation
> ### A very important step for mitigating fucky-wuckies!

**\[ [Next â‡¾](./01-base.md) \]**  

**TODO:** Finish creating the "Oh shit! stick" (OSS) which is a bootable USB drive to which grub is installed with a loopback configuration for multiple ISOs. Updating the installation medium is (generally) as easy as dragging and dropping the new ISO file, which can be convenient if you just got home from Micro Center with the shiniest new (amd/intel of course) GPU.  
  
Currently...I am still struggling getting any ISO to boot in loopback *other* than Arch-based ISOs.
