The current entries in this folder are almost certain to become obsolete as this is the configuration for systemd-boot.  
  
Replacing systemd-boot is the vast majority of my reason for reinstalling so these will likely serve as nothing more but a reference.  
  
When they do become obsolete, consider moving them into the `Misc/` folder.
