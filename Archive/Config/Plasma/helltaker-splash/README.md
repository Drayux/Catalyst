# Custom KDE Splash Screen 
### _**TODO:**_ Find artist (and link) of original art

To "install" this splash screen, place this folder (excluding this readme) inside of `~/.local/plasma/look-and-feel/Helltaker`  
This directory will not exist if no third-party splash screens have been installed yet.
