# Applications
### Cider
This is a great replacement for **Apple Music**  

It implements the vast majority of proprietary features and works really quite well. My only complaints are that the "new version" is for Windows _and_ paid what the fuck??  

Some of the UI elements don't behave quite as one would expect. (For example the music queue and history is in the bottom right corner for the default layout.)  

**Setup**  
One of the only important settings is to set up the Last.FM scrobbing - This can be found in the `Connectivity` tab of the settings page.  

### Muffon
Muffon is an "all services" audio application  

It is early in development so there exist many bugs (such as outright not launching last I'd used it) however it has considerable potential, and its API hooks allow for an impressive use case without an account.  

### Spotify
Native linux client  

Highly consider this if I decide to subscribe to Spotify instead of Apple Music.
