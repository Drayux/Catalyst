This directory contains a collection of future projects I hope to build for my personal linux environment. Specifically these are major projects that are yet to begin, not various TODO elements like creating a PKGBUILD for my custom OBS config, etc.  
  
Within each entry here, there will be a rough description of the idea, what problem it seeks to solve, and any resources I've collected in my preliminary research. Essentially, this will turn into the project README if said project were to turn into a new Git repo.
